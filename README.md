# NFLX_TSLA_Analysis
Analysis of NFLX and TSLA stocks


- This Analysis was undertaken in order to compare the fluctuating stock prices of two technology based companies - Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) for a year period starting in May of 2020 and ending in May of 2021.  These companies, along with many other companies that would be considered technology companies (Apple, Google, Nvidia etc) have seen their sky rocketing valuations stand out, even in a market that on the whole, is currently experiencing a prolonged period of growth across all sectors.  

- To better understand the underpinning ascension of these two companies, I used the Pandas DataReader libary to examine finanical data from Yahoo Finance using their APIs.  From here, I expanded on the available data by creating new columns for finanical analysis tools such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) idicators, Simple Moving Averages (sMA), Expoential Moving Averages (EMA), Stochastic Oscillators among others.  Utilizing those tools, I was able to exmaine in more depth analysis on exactly how those stocks performed and how solid the numbers behind those performances were.
